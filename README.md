# rastriya_vidyarthi_sangh
I built this app for a society named Rastriya Vidyarthi Sangh(National Student's Association) of students from Nepal in India.
Useful information related to different students meetings will be shared through this app.
One can connect to Group Leaders through this app.

This is the homeactivity or mainactivity.Here information about previous and upcoming events will be uploaded.
Current events are just demos.
